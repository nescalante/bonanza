```

# Angular support

Just use [this package](https://github.com/nescalante/bonanza-ng) instead

# Usage

You just need an input to work on and a function (a.k.a. callback) that returns your favorite data

## `bonanza(element, options?, callback | list)`

- `element` (required): 
  a `HTMLInput` Javascript element that will be used for autocompletion
- `options` (optional):
  a set of parameters to customize `bonanza` as needed
- `callback | list` (required):
  `bonanza` doesn't know how to get your data, so it needs a function that receives a query, and returns the rows that will be used to fill the autocomplete info, or even an array with all the results that you need to display.

The example below shows you how to easily set up `bonanza` for an `input` element:

```js
bonanza(element, function (query, callback) {
  get('/someApi?query=' + query.search + '&offset=' + query.offset + '&limit=' + query.limit, function (err, data) {
    if (err) {
      callback(err);
      return;
    }
    
    callback(null, data);
  });
});
```

The `options` are detailed below:

#### `options.templates`

An object with a set of functions. Here you have a detailed table with all that you need to replace:

Property  | Default                                     | Usage
--------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------
item      | `(obj) => obj`                              | List items
label     | `(obj) => obj                               | Input value when user selects some item
noResults | `(search) => \`No results for "${search}"\` | Showed when query returns no results
loadMore  | `...`                                       | Showed at bottom when there is more data to show
loading   | `Loading ...`                               | Showed at bottom when loading more data

#### `options.css`

An object with a set of CSS class names. The detailed list of css classes by default can be found below:

Property      | Default                 | Purpose
------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------
container     | `bz-container`          | The `div` class for the main container
hide          | `bz-hide`               | Class to hide the container
list          | `bz-list`               | The class for the `ul` inside the container
item          | `bz-list-item`          | Every `li` element for the results
selected      | `bz-list-item-selected` | When an item is being selected
loading       | `bz-list-loading`       | The "loading" `li` item
loadMore      | `bz-list-load-more`     | The "load more" `li` item
noResults     | `bz-list-no-results`    | The `li` item showed when no results for last search
inputLoading  | `bz-loading`            | A class for the `input` element when loading
match         | `bz-text-match`         | A class when the search matches the text on an item

#### `options.openOnFocus`

A boolean that decides whatever the list will be open on focus event or not. `true` by default.

#### `options.showLoading`

If `true` it will show a loading text when `bonanza` does the first search (with the list empty). `true` by defualt.

#### `options.showLoadMore`

If `true` it will show a "load more" legend text when `bonanza` has more items to show. `true` by defualt.

#### `options.limit`

The max number of rows expected, `10` by default.

#### `options.scrollDistance`

The distance in px before the bottom that will make `bonanza` start loading more items. `0` by default.

#### `options.hasMoreItems`

A function that helps to decide whatever the list being accesed has more items to display or not. By default is this function:

```js
function (result) { return !!result.length && result.length === this.limit; }
```

#### `options.getItems`

This will be used to parse what you send from your callback, to the array that `bonanza` expects as a result. It contains the following function by default:

```js
function (result) { return result; }
```

# API

The object being returned after initializing `bonanza` is an [`EventEmitter` instance](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_events_eventemitter). `bonanza` emits a set of events detailed below:

Event   | Definition
------- | ---------------------------------------
focus   | When the user made focus on the input element
change  | Every time the user picks an option
select  | Every time the user selects an option, usually navigating the list with the arrow keys
cancel  | Every time the user cancels the operation, usually touching the <kbd>esc</kbd> key
open    | When something opens the items list
close   | When the user or an event closes the list
search  | When starting to do a search
success | When the search returns data
error   | Every time an error sadly occurs

The `dist` folder as well as the version in the `package.json` file should *not* be modified. Create a PR with your changes and if needed a test asserting them. Once merged a new version will be uploaded to bower and npm with the `dist` folder updated.
